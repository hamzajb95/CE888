I used the raw links of the datasets to import them into the notebook directly from the TweetEval github repo which can be accessed from here: https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval
#### Emotion Dataset:
https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets/emotion
#### Hate Speech:
https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets/hate
#### Offensive Language
https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets/offensive

I understand that the datasets were to be uploaded into the repository however my code allows you to simply call on the datasets originally available on the links provided above.

## Instructions:
Simply open Notebook and Run all Cells. The data will be accessed transformations will be applied the Model will classify the Tweets and provide results.
